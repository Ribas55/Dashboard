When I ask to extract data from [2022-2025.xlsx](mdc:2022-2025.xlsx) remember that the first row is the title.

Also I only want you to take into account the following 15 "Familia":
Cream Cracker
Maria
Wafer
Sortido
Cobertas de Chocolate
Água e Sal
Digestiva
Recheada
Circus
Tartelete
Torrada
Flocos de Neve
Integral
Mentol
Aliança

Structure of the excel : main titles- "Gestor Comercial", "Familia", "Sub Familia", "Gramagem", "Formato", "Material Mapeado" (SKU), "Valor Kg" (The sales data we are analysing) and "Data do faturamento" (the time component of our time series)
